# FitPulse: Health Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

FitPulse is a full-stack health analytics and anomaly detection platform built to analyze wearable fitness data such as heart rate, step count, sleep duration, and weight. The system detects abnormal health patterns using machine learning techniques, forecasts future trends using time-series models, and generates AI-based wellness insights through an interactive dashboard.

The application follows a modular client–server architecture:
- Streamlit is used for the frontend visualization and interaction
- FastAPI powers the backend for data processing, ML pipelines, forecasting, and report generation

## Key Features

- Upload and preprocess wearable health datasets  
- Feature engineering using rolling statistics  
- Anomaly detection using:  
  - Rule-based medical thresholds  
  - DBSCAN clustering  
- Time-series forecasting using Facebook Prophet  
- Interactive health trend visualization  
- AI-based personalized wellness recommendations  
- CSV and PDF report generation  
- Modular and scalable architecture

## Dataset Information

**Dataset Source (Kaggle)**  
[Fitbit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

### Files Used

- `minuteSleep_merged.csv` – Sleep duration and quality  
- `heartrate_seconds_merged.csv` – Continuous heart rate readings  
- `weightLogInfo_merged.csv` – Weight and BMI information  
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv` – Daily steps and activity data  

---

## Data Preparation Process

1. Individual preprocessing on all datasets:  
   - Timestamp normalization  
   - Data type conversions  
   - Missing value handling  

2. Dataset merging:  
   - Inner join between heart rate and steps → `clean_Dataset.csv`  
   - Left join with sleep and weight datasets → `final_Dataset.csv`  

3. `final_Dataset.csv` is used as the primary input for the system.

---

## System Workflow

1. Data upload and validation  
2. Data preprocessing and normalization  
3. Feature engineering using rolling mean and rolling standard deviation  
4. Anomaly detection:  
   - Rule-based threshold detection  
   - DBSCAN clustering  
5. Time-series forecasting using Prophet  
6. Visualization of trends and anomalies  
7. AI-based wellness advice generation  
8. CSV and PDF report generation

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pyngrok pandas numpy prophet scikit-learn matplotlib plotly streamlit requests openai reportlab
```

### 2. Start Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn backend:app --port 8003
```

Backend runs at:

```bash
http://localhost:8003
```

### 3. Start Frontend Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The Streamlit dashboard opens in the browser and communicates with the backend using REST APIs.
